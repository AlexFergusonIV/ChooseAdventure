# ChooseAdventure
This is a choose your own adventure game.  This is very preliminary and can be altered as necessary. Updates include deleting the or case in the if statements (since the input is changed to lowercase automatically) and expanding the branching paths.  Also, a loop can be created to send you back if you fail to enter a recognized command in the terminal.
